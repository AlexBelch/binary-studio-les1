# A roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2017

These charts were created by GitHub user **Kamranahmedse**. They visualize three roadmaps to becoming a web developer.

Even though I disagree with some of his suggestions (I recommend you starting building projects almost immediately — and you will with **freeCodeCamp’s curriculum**), I still think this is worth reading. It will give you a birds-eye view of the modern tools that web developers use.

Here’s his chart for front-end development:

And for back-end development:

And for DevOps, which he views as an extension of back-end development:

Of course, these just the tools. Check out Saul Costa’s exploration of the underlying software development skills, which are far more important than the tools (__*5 minute read*__)

And here are three other links worth your time:

 - How one camper turned a rejected conference talk into 300,000 views on Medium and YouTube (__*4 minute read*__)
 - How the Atom team got their JavaScript-based code editor to start up significantly faster (__*6 minute read*__)
 - Dive into Deep Learning with one of these 23 online courses (__*8 minute read*__)

If you Google “once in a blue moon” it will tell you the precise frequency of blue moons in hertz.
